/**
 * @fileoverview Firebase configuration object.
 *
 * @description
 * This file exports the `firebaseConfig` object, which contains the necessary credentials
 * to connect the front-end application to your Firebase project. These values are
 * automatically generated when you create a web app in the Firebase console.
 *
 * It is safe to expose these values in a client-side application. Firebase security
 * is enforced by Security Rules on the backend, not by hiding these keys.
